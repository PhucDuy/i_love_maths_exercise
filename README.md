# I LOVE MATHS --- EXERCISE 

### 🔰 Coder School FTMLE in-class exercise based on hoahh2201 project about "OCR Handwritten Digits and Maths Performance".
The lite version can detect handwritten sketch on canvas and can do simple plus + and minus - operations. The final evaluated result will be returned.

### 🔰 Libraries:
- tensorflow 2.0
- flask
- imutils
- mahotas 
- opencv

### 🔰 Steps to finish this exercise:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Change directory to model_ml, train the ```multidigit_classifier.ipynb``` with ```complete_data``` set. 
3. Fine tune and export the model.  
4. Work on ```preprocess_with_opencv.ipynb``` to transform a raw image into what our model can predict.
5. Finish the discussions at the end of the notebook.
6. Move to ```app``` and copy the code you did on ```preprocess_with_opencv.ipynb``` to ```main.py``` regarding the "YOUR PART" pointer.

Extra:
7. Re-design the flaskapp or Adding more maths expression to the model.
8. Get a good sleep because if you reach this point, you are probably tired and really in need of some self care 💆🏻‍♀️ Come back later for more challenge. 💙
